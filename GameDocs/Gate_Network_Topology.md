# Gate Network Topology

This document defines how interstellar gate networks are structured, secured, and traversed.
The goal is to ensure **strategic depth, danger gradients, and emergent trade conflict** across the galaxy.

---

## Core Design Principles
- Core factions control **high-security inner regions**
- Travel between core factions requires passing through **progressively less secure space**
- Trade routes are valuable because they are dangerous
- Expansion naturally pushes players and factions outward
- Rare materials require risk, not grind

---

## Galactic Region Layers

The galaxy is divided into **five functional security layers** surrounding each core faction.

---

## 1. Core Systems (Inner Core)

**Description**
- Home system of each core faction
- Heavily fortified and politically sensitive
- Losing a core system is galaxy-shaking

**Security**
- Maximum gate security
- Permanent capital fleets
- Automated defense platforms
- Rapid response forces

**Gameplay Rules**
- Extremely difficult to attack
- Heavy tariffs and regulations
- Player expansion not tolerated
- Best place for:
  - Stability
  - Advanced infrastructure
  - Political missions

**Resources**
- Abundant basic materials
- High industrial output
- Limited access to rare materials

---

## 2. Inner Faction Systems (Controlled Space)

**Description**
- Systems directly ruled by a core faction
- Economically productive and politically stable
- Faction identity is strong

**Security**
- Strong gate patrols
- System defense fleets
- Quick reinforcement from core systems

**Gameplay Rules**
- Safe for trade and transit
- Player presence tolerated but monitored
- Military actions provoke swift retaliation

**Resources**
- Abundant common materials
- Moderate specialty materials
- Manufacturing hubs

---

## 3. Outer Faction Systems (Frontier Holdings)

**Description**
- Edge territory of core factions
- Less stable and more expensive to police
- Frequent target of raids and proxy wars

**Security**
- Patrols are intermittent
- Slower response times
- Security quality varies by faction

**Gameplay Rules**
- Increased piracy
- Political tension
- Opportunity for influence and contracts
- Player expansion possible but risky

**Resources**
- Common materials
- Some rare material deposits
- Strategic chokepoints

---

## 4. Trade & Minor Faction Space (Buffer Zone)

**Description**
- Systems not owned by core factions
- Controlled by:
  - Minor factions
  - Trade leagues
  - City-states
  - Corporate enclaves

**Security**
- Localized security forces
- Hired mercenaries
- Convoy escorts on major routes

**Gameplay Rules**
- **Player starting region**
- Safer than the outer rim
- Highly dynamic political environment
- Ideal for:
  - Early expansion
  - Trade empires
  - Diplomatic play

**Resources**
- Abundant common materials
- Reliable access to markets
- Limited rare materials

---

## 5. Outer Rim (Lawless Space)

**Description**
- No lasting major faction control
- Pirate clans, warlords, and ruins dominate
- Constant flux

**Security**
- None by default
- Pirate patrols replace law enforcement
- Temporary faction expeditions only

**Gameplay Rules**
- High-risk, high-reward
- Best expansion opportunities
- Frequent fleet losses
- Ideal for:
  - Rare resource extraction
  - Hidden bases
  - Black market trade

**Resources**
- Scarce common materials
- High concentration of rare materials
- Unique and exotic resources

---

## Gate Network Structure

### Gate Density
- Core → Inner: Dense, redundant
- Inner → Outer: Moderate
- Outer → Trade Zone: Sparse
- Trade Zone → Outer Rim: Minimal and unstable

### Distance Rules
- Core-to-core travel typically requires:
  - 6–10 gate jumps
  - Passing through at least 3 security layers
- Chokepoints are intentional and valuable

---

## Trade Routes

**Major Trade Routes**
- Heavily trafficked paths through buffer zones
- Partial security provided by:
  - Convoy escorts
  - Corporate security
  - Temporary faction patrols

**Secondary Routes**
- Less secure
- Used by smugglers and Nomari clans
- Higher profit margins

---

## Player Start Logic

- Player begins with:
  - A small ship
  - Minimal resources
- Starting location:
  - Trade & Minor Faction Space
- Immediate access to:
  - Markets
  - Contracts
  - Safer expansion options

The player is **never dropped into core or outer rim space at start**.

---

## Resource & Progression Logic

### Common Materials
- Widely available in:
  - Core systems
  - Inner faction systems
  - Trade zones

Used for:
- Basic ships
- Stations
- Infrastructure
- Early fleet expansion

### Rare Materials
- Concentrated in:
  - Outer faction systems
  - Outer rim space

Required for:
- Advanced ship components
- Capital ships
- Rare station modules
- High-tier technology research

This enforces **risk-based progression**, not grind-based progression.

---

## Strategic Outcomes

This topology guarantees:
- Dangerous midpoints between powers
- Natural pirate growth zones
- Valuable and contested trade corridors
- Meaningful reasons to explore and expand
- A living galaxy that reshapes over time

---

## Version Notes
This topology is designed to be:
- Scalable
- Simulation-friendly
- Multiplayer-safe
- Resistant to static equilibrium

Changes to gate density or security should be treated as **major balance events**.
