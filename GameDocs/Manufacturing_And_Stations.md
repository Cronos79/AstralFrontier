# Manufacturing and Stations

This document defines **stations**, **manufacturing**, and **industrial progression**.
Stations are expensive, strategic milestones — not early convenience tools.

The core goal is:
- Force meaningful choices
- Prevent early all-in-one stations
- Make specialization matter
- Tie power to planning, not speed

---

## Design Philosophy
- Stations are **rare and costly**
- Every station represents commitment
- Early choices lock paths temporarily
- Expansion requires planning and logistics
- Industrial dominance is earned, not rushed

A station is not “a base” — it is **an economic and political statement**.

---

## Station as a Milestone

### Cost Expectations
- Even the smallest station:
  - Requires refined materials
  - Requires manufactured components
  - Represents a major early-game investment

Losing a station should hurt.

---

### Visibility & Consequences
- Stations are visible assets
- They attract attention from:
  - Pirates
  - Minor factions
  - Core factions
- Building one changes how the galaxy treats you

---

## Station Structure

### Core Module
Every station begins with:
- Command Core
- Basic Power Generation
- Minimal Docking Ring
- Limited Storage

The core does **almost nothing by itself**.

---

### Addon Slot System
Stations have a **limited number of addon slots**.

Slots are:
- Fixed at construction
- Extremely expensive to expand
- The primary balancing lever

You cannot do everything at once.

---

## Station Addon Categories

### Industrial Addons
- Refineries
- Component Factories
- Shipyards

High power usage, high visibility, high risk.

---

### Trade Addons
- Trade Docks
- Market Halls
- Commerce Zones
- Tariff Offices

Generate income and influence, but attract traffic and piracy.

---

### Military Addons
- Weapon Platforms
- Hangar Bays
- Defense Grids
- Fleet Support Modules

Increase survival but provoke escalation.

---

### Utility Addons
- Storage Expansion
- Sensor Arrays
- Repair Facilities
- Research Labs

Support specialization and long-term growth.

---

## Early-Game Station Paths

At first, a player must **choose one primary role**:

### Industrial Outpost
- Refining or light manufacturing
- Vulnerable to attack
- Requires supply lines

### Trade Hub
- Generates steady income
- Politically sensitive
- Dependent on stability

### Defensive Stronghold
- Hard to remove
- Expensive to maintain
- Low economic output

Specialization is enforced by slot limits.

---

## Tech Tree Progression

### Tiered Technology Model

#### Tier I – Foundational
- Small stations
- Basic ships
- Light industry
- Minimal defenses

Accessible early, but limited.

---

#### Tier II – Regional Power
- Medium stations
- Advanced components
- Medium ships
- Trade specialization

Requires:
- Rare materials
- Research investment
- Stable economy

---

#### Tier III – Major Power
- Large stations
- Capital shipyards
- Advanced defenses
- Economic dominance

Requires:
- Rare materials
- Political stability
- High visibility and risk

---

## Ship Manufacturing Constraints
- Small ships:
  - Can be built at basic shipyards
- Medium ships:
  - Require advanced manufacturing modules
- Capital ships:
  - Require dedicated capital shipyards
  - Cannot be rushed
  - Require rare materials and FTL fuels

---

## Trade, Taxation, and Control

### Commerce Mechanics
- Stations with trade modules can:
  - Host markets
  - Charge docking fees
  - Tax transactions
  - Control local supply flow

Higher taxes increase:
- Profit
- Smuggling
- Pirate interest
- Political tension

---

## Station Growth and Limits

### Expansion Limits
- Addon slots are scarce
- Power and heat limits apply
- Expansion costs grow exponentially

You must build **multiple specialized stations**, not one mega-station.

---

### Maintenance and Decay
- Stations require:
  - Ongoing material input
  - Power and fuel
  - Crew and logistics
- Neglect causes:
  - Reduced output
  - Vulnerability
  - Eventual shutdown

---

## Strategic Implications
- Industry creates targets
- Trade creates wealth and enemies
- Defense creates deterrence, not safety
- No station is safe forever

The galaxy pushes back.

---

## Player Playstyles Enabled
- Industrial magnate
- Trade monopolist
- Fortress builder
- Logistics empire
- Regional stabilizer
- Pirate-backed shadow power

All paths interact with the same systems.

---

## Version Notes
Stations are intentionally restrictive.
If a station can:
- Build everything
- Defend perfectly
- Generate infinite wealth

Then the design has failed.

Restrictions are what make choices meaningful.
