# Interdiction and Blockades

This document defines how **movement, supply chains, and territory control** are contested.
Interdiction and blockades are strategic tools that often matter more than fleet destruction.

The goal is to make logistics warfare:
- Powerful
- Persistent
- Risky
- Politically meaningful

---

## Core Design Principles
- Destroying supply is often better than destroying fleets
- Control of movement equals control of power
- Blockades are gradual pressure, not instant shutdowns
- Interdiction creates tension without requiring total war

Wars are won by **denial**, not annihilation.

---

## Interdiction Defined

**Interdiction** is the act of disrupting movement and logistics without owning territory.

Interdiction can target:
- Gate traffic
- Trade convoys
- FTL routes
- Supply lines
- Station throughput

It is scalable, deniable, and persistent.

---

## Gate Interdiction

### Gate Control Zones
Each gate projects a **control zone** into the surrounding system.

Control is influenced by:
- Patrol presence
- Defense platforms
- Sensor coverage
- Faction authority

---

### Interdiction Actions
- Patrol harassment
- Toll enforcement
- Temporary blockades
- Sabotage operations
- Pirate cooperation

Interdiction does not close a gate outright — it **adds cost and risk**.

---

### Effects of Gate Interdiction
- Increased travel time
- Higher fuel consumption
- Cargo loss risk
- Trade price inflation
- Smuggling growth

Heavy interdiction can make routes economically unviable.

---

## System Blockades

### Definition
A blockade restricts **system-level access**, usually focused on:
- Stations
- Planets
- Orbital infrastructure

Blockades require sustained presence.

---

### Blockade Strength Factors
- Fleet tonnage
- Capital ship presence
- Local defenses
- Sensor dominance
- Supply endurance

Blockades weaken if not maintained.

---

### Blockade Effects
- Reduced import/export
- Industrial slowdown
- Civil unrest
- Pirate emergence
- Diplomatic pressure

Blockades take time to have full effect.

---

## FTL Interdiction

### Capital FTL Vulnerability
FTL travel is powerful but detectable.

Interdiction methods include:
- FTL sensor nets
- Jump-point prediction
- Signal triangulation
- Ambush corridors

FTL interdiction is rare and expensive.

---

### FTL Interdiction Outcomes
- Forced early exits
- Damage on arrival
- Increased cooldown
- Exposure of destination

No FTL jump is truly safe.

---

## Trade Route Warfare

### Major Routes
- High volume
- Partial security
- Prime interdiction targets

### Secondary Routes
- Lower volume
- Higher profit
- More vulnerable

Trade wars are often undeclared.

---

## Pirate Role in Interdiction

Pirates naturally thrive under interdiction pressure:
- Disrupted patrols
- Higher smuggling traffic
- Reduced enforcement

Factions may:
- Fund pirates
- Ignore pirates
- Later suppress pirates they created

---

## Player Interaction

### Early Game
- Escort convoys
- Suppress pirates
- Run smuggling operations

### Mid Game
- Conduct limited interdiction
- Enforce tolls
- Apply economic pressure

### Late Game
- Sustain multi-system blockades
- Control chokepoints
- Collapse rival economies

---

## Political Consequences
- Interdiction increases diplomatic tension
- Blockades are acts of war
- Proxy interdiction provides plausible deniability
- Prolonged blockades invite third-party intervention

---

## Strategic Outcomes
- Empires collapse without being invaded
- Wars end due to economic exhaustion
- Trade hubs become flashpoints
- Gate networks define history

---

## Version Notes
Interdiction should always:
- Be cheaper than invasion
- Require persistence
- Create consequences

If fleets are the only way to win wars, the design has failed.
