# Astral Frontier -- Living Universe Design Overview

## Core Vision

Astral Frontier is a simulation-first space strategy game inspired by
classic text-based empire games, reimagined for a modern 3D interface.
The universe is the main character. AI factions act independently,
history is persistent, and the player is only one force among many.

## Universe Philosophy

-   The universe evolves whether the player is present or not.
-   No scripted main story -- history emerges from systems interacting.
-   Power is temporary. Everything is destructible.
-   Expansion creates instability, piracy, and resistance.

## Race vs Faction

Race represents biology and culture.\
Faction represents political power.

Players may choose the same race as a core faction but are never part of
that faction. Shared race provides trade and diplomatic advantages, not
political protection.

## Core Factions

-   8 core factions/races exist at game start.
-   Each has a named home system and capital planet.
-   Core factions begin strong with capital ships, economies, and
    defended territory.
-   They can lose territory and even collapse, though total destruction
    is extremely rare.

## Player Start

-   Player starts as an independent faction.
-   No territory, no capital ships, minimal resources.
-   Neutral relations with 7 core factions.
-   Slightly positive relations with their own race's core faction.
-   The player must grow in frontier or contested space.

## Travel Rules

### Small & Medium Ships

-   In-system travel
-   Inter-system travel only via gates

### Capital Ships

-   True FTL travel
-   Uses rare fuel
-   Cooldowns, maintenance, and operational risk
-   Strategic mobility, not spammable power

## Galaxy Structure

-   Core regions are dense, stable, and well-policed.
-   Core-to-core travel requires multiple gate jumps (\~6--10).
-   Frontier systems between cores are pirate-heavy and unstable.
-   Minor factions and pirate clans dominate the space between powers.

## Economy & Mining

-   Solar systems contain planets, moons, and asteroid belts.
-   Each can host multiple mining nodes.
-   Mining nodes are the smallest economic unit.
-   Resources drive trade, conflict, and expansion.
-   Depletion, regeneration, and ownership are simulated.

## Cities & Control

-   Cities exist on planets and moons.
-   Controlled by factions, minor factions, or pirates.
-   City stance toward player depends on faction reputation.
-   Cities can be friendly, neutral, hostile, captured, or destroyed.

## Piracy & Instability

-   Piracy increases with poor policing and overextension.
-   Pirates grow stronger near wealthy trade routes.
-   Pirates may be secretly funded by rival factions.
-   Ignoring piracy can destabilize entire regions.

## Expansion Pressure

As factions grow: - Policing costs rise - Corruption increases - Piracy
intensifies - Rebellion risk grows

Large empires are powerful but fragile.

## Permadeath Rules

-   Ships, fleets, stations, cities, and factions can be destroyed
    permanently.
-   Player losses are permanent.
-   The player persists as an organization/dynasty, not an immortal
    hero.

## Player Paths

-   Military conquest
-   Trade empire and logistics hub
-   Diplomatic manipulation and proxy influence

All paths use the same underlying systems.

## Presentation Layer (UE5)

-   3D galaxy map
-   System-level orbital views
-   Clickable planets, belts, stations, and cities
-   Data-driven visuals instead of FPS gameplay

## First Playable Milestone

-   One core-adjacent frontier region
-   One minor faction
-   Active pirate pressure
-   Player survives long enough to attract attention
-   The universe responds
