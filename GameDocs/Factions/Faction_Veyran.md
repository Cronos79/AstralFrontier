## Attitude Toward Player (Same Race)
Commercially favorable. Better contracts, lower fees, faster credit access—trust grows with reliability, not sentiment.

## Attitude Toward Player (Other Races)
Transactional neutrality. Reputation affects pricing, access, and risk tolerance.

Political struggles are fought with contracts, not coups.

## Long-Term AI Goals
