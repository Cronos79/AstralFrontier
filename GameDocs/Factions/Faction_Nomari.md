## Technology Focus
- Mobile habitats and stations
- Long-range navigation and scanning
- Logistics compression and efficiency
- Salvage and rapid-repair systems

## Attitude Toward Player (Same Race)
Welcoming but cautious. Trust is earned through reliability and respect for clan autonomy.

## Attitude Toward Player (Other Races)
Generally neutral. Will trade with almost anyone unless repeatedly betrayed.

## Internal Politics
- Independent Clans
- Trade Moots
- Route Councils

Disputes are resolved through negotiated separation rather than domination.

## Long-Term AI Goals
- Preserve freedom of movement
- Maintain access to major trade corridors
- Avoid domination by any single core faction
- Thrive in frontier and contested regions

## Collapse Conditions (Rare)
- Systematic destruction of mobile habitats
- Loss of navigational knowledge
- Forced settlement by hostile powers
- Internal fragmentation beyond recovery

## Lore Note
The Nomari abandoned fixed worlds generations ago after repeated devastation, choosing freedom of movement over territorial power.
