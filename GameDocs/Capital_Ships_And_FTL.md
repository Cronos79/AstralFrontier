# Capital Ships and FTL

This document defines **capital ships**, their construction costs, movement rules, and fuel requirements.
Capital ships are rare, strategic assets that shape the galaxy — not everyday tools.

---

## Design Philosophy
- Capital ships are **expensive, slow to replace, and politically significant**
- They project power across regions, not just systems
- Their movement defines strategic reach
- Fuel scarcity enforces risk, planning, and logistics

Capital ships are **infrastructure-level assets**, not upgrades.

## Ship Size Classes

### Small Ships
Examples:
- Scouts
- Freighters
- Fighters
- Corvettes

**Movement**
- In-system travel only
- Gate-based interstellar travel

**Fuel**
- Cheap chemical or fusion fuels
- Widely available in:
  - Core systems
  - Trade zones
- Low operational cost

---

### Medium Ships
Examples:
- Frigates
- Destroyers
- Light carriers

**Movement**
- In-system travel
- Gate-based interstellar travel

**Fuel**
- Refined fuel cells
- Moderate cost
- Requires industrial supply chains

---

### Capital Ships
Examples:
- Battleships
- Dreadnoughts
- Fleet Carriers
- Mobile Shipyards

**Movement**
- In-system travel
- Independent **FTL travel**
- Gate usage optional but inefficient

Capital ships define strategic mobility.

---

## Capital Ship Construction

### Required Materials
Capital ships require **advanced manufactured components**, built from rare resources.

Examples:
- Titanium Alloy Hull Plates
- Reinforced Bulkheads
- Superconductive Wiring
- Capital-Grade Reactors
- Advanced Sensor and Command Cores

These components require:
- Rare ores (outer faction space / outer rim)
- Advanced refineries
- High industrial capacity

---

### Construction Constraints
- Long build times
- Requires dedicated shipyards
- Limited parallel construction
- High visibility (others notice)

Losing a capital ship is a **major historical event**.

---

## Movement Types

### 1. Sub-Light (In-System Travel)
Used by all ships.

**Fuel**
- Cheap reaction mass
- Fusion drives
- Widely available fuels

**Availability**
- Core systems
- Inner faction systems
- Trade zones

This keeps normal travel accessible.

---

### 2. Gate Travel
Used by:
- Small ships
- Medium ships
- Capital ships (optional)

**Fuel**
- Minimal onboard fuel
- Gate energy cost handled externally

**Limitations**
- Predictable routes
- Chokepoints
- Vulnerable to interdiction

---

### 3. Capital FTL Travel

Capital-only movement system.

**Requirements**
- Capital-class FTL drive
- Specialized navigation systems
- Rare fuel types

**Fuel Types**
- Exotic Gases
- High-density FTL fuel
- Stabilized antimatter analogs (very rare)

**Fuel Sources**
- Outer rim gas giants
- Deep-space anomalies
- Rare processing facilities

---

### FTL Constraints
- Long cooldowns
- High fuel consumption
- Significant heat and wear
- Increased maintenance cost

FTL is **power projection**, not convenience.

---

## FTL Risk Model
Each FTL jump carries risk:
- Misjump damage
- Component degradation
- Detection by hostile factions
- Interdiction attempts

Risk increases with:
- Jump distance
- Poor navigation data
- Damaged systems

---

## Strategic Implications

### For Core Factions
- Capitals defend core and inner systems
- Limited deep strikes into hostile territory
- Logistics constrain prolonged campaigns

### For Players
- First capital ship is a major milestone
- Requires:
  - Rare material access
  - Stable economy
  - Political consequences
- Enables:
  - Independent expansion
  - Deep-space operations
  - Strategic disruption

## Fuel Economy Summary

| Movement Type | Ship Class | Fuel Type | Availability |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Sub-Light | All | Common fuel | Everywhere |
| Gate Travel | Small / Medium | Gate power | Gate-controlled |
| FTL | Capital | Rare gases & fuels | Outer regions |

---

## Balance Outcomes
- No capital ship spam
- Supply chains matter
- Gate networks remain relevant
- Outer rim stays valuable
- Wars have logistical limits

---

## Version Notes
Capital ships should always feel:
- Rare
- Powerful
- Risky
- Politically destabilizing

Any change that makes them common should be treated as a **critical balance failure**.
