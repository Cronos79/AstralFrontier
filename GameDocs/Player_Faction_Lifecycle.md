# Player Faction Lifecycle

This document defines how a **player-founded faction** is born, grows, peaks, and potentially collapses.
The player is not a chosen hero — they are a political and economic actor in a living universe.

Every decision has consequences.

---

## Core Design Philosophy
- The player is **one power among many**
- Choices permanently affect relationships
- There is no guaranteed success path
- Wealth, power, and safety are trade-offs
- Collapse is possible — and meaningful

The universe reacts to the player, not the other way around.

---

## Player as a Faction

The player does not control a character — they control a **faction**.

A player faction has:
- Reputation with every other faction
- Territory (or none)
- Assets (ships, stations, contracts)
- An economic profile
- A historical footprint

If assets are lost, the faction weakens.
If trust is lost, options disappear.

---

## Core Currencies

### Space Credits
Abstract currency representing:
- Contracts
- Trade profits
- Taxes
- Services

Used for:
- Paying crews
- Buying materials
- Hiring escorts
- Bribes and diplomacy
- Market transactions

Credits flow easily but are vulnerable to disruption.

---

### Materials
Physical resources:
- Raw
- Refined
- Manufactured

Used for:
- Construction
- Repair
- Expansion
- Technology unlocks

Materials are harder to move, harder to protect, and harder to replace.

---

## Lifecycle Phases

---

## Phase I – Survival

**Player State**
- One ship
- Minimal credits
- No territory
- Unknown or ignored

**Primary Activities**
- Trade
- Escort contracts
- Small-scale mining
- Smuggling
- Exploration

**Key Risks**
- Pirates
- Bankruptcy
- Reputation damage

**Design Intent**
Teach systems without protection.
Early mistakes matter, but are survivable.

---

## Phase II – Specialization

**Player State**
- First station
- Recognizable presence
- Emerging reputation

**Primary Choices**
The player must choose a direction:
- Trade-focused
- Industrial-focused
- Military-focused
- Hybrid (at higher risk)

Early specialization defines relationships.

---

## Phase III – Regional Power

**Player State**
- Multiple stations or systems
- Trade routes or fleets
- Political relevance

**Primary Activities**
- Taxation
- Route control
- Diplomatic deals
- Proxy conflicts

**Consequences**
- Rivals form
- Allies expect support
- Pirates respond to wealth

This is where most factions fail.

---

## Phase IV – Major Power or Collapse

**Two Possible Outcomes**

### A) Ascension
- Player becomes a regional hegemon
- Controls trade corridors or production chains
- Negotiates with core factions as a peer

This requires constant management.

---

### B) Collapse
- Overextension
- Too many enemies
- Economic disruption
- Internal decay

Collapse may be:
- Gradual
- Sudden
- Partial (loss of territory)

The universe remembers.

---

## Reputation and Relationships

### Reputation Is Persistent
- Every action modifies reputation
- There is no reset
- Neutrality is fragile

Good trade relations reduce costs.
Hostility increases risk and price.

---

### Enemy Accumulation
Making too many enemies causes:
- Trade embargoes
- Piracy spikes
- Coordinated attacks
- Diplomatic isolation

Being universally hated is unsustainable.

---

## Taxation and Trade Control

### Player Taxes
Players with stations and trade hubs can:
- Charge docking fees
- Tax transactions
- Enforce tariffs

Higher taxes:
- Increase income
- Increase smuggling
- Increase pirate activity
- Reduce goodwill

---

### Trade Empire Path
A trade-focused player can:
- Buy rare materials instead of mining
- Control markets and logistics
- Profit from instability elsewhere

Economic power avoids some wars but invites others.

---

## Industry vs Economy

### Industrial Path
- Control supply chains
- Lower long-term costs
- High visibility
- Vulnerable to blockades

---

### Economic Path
- High liquidity
- Flexible response
- Reliant on markets
- Vulnerable to market collapse

Both are viable.
Neither is safe.

---

## War and Peace

War is rarely declared outright.
Most conflict happens via:
- Interdiction
- Proxy actions
- Economic pressure

Direct war is expensive and dangerous.

---

## Failure Is a Feature

If a player faction collapses:
- Assets are lost
- Reputation persists
- The galaxy moves on

The player may:
- Rebuild
- Shift strategy
- Become a minor power
- Fade into history

Collapse is not game over — it is narrative.

---

## Strategic Takeaways
- Every path is risky
- Stability requires effort
- Wealth attracts danger
- Neutrality is temporary
- The universe does not forgive negligence

---

## Version Notes
This lifecycle is intentionally harsh.
If players can:
- Win safely
- Avoid consequences
- Ignore politics

Then the simulation has failed.
