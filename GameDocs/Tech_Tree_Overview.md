# Tech Tree Overview

This document defines how **technology progression** works in the universe.
The goal is to avoid abstract research grinding and instead tie advancement to
**industry, materials, discovery, and commitment**.

Technology is not “invented” by the player — it is **unlocked through capability**.

---

## Core Design Principles

- No research point spam
- No tech labs generating abstract numbers
- Technology is **earned, not clicked**
- Progression is slow, deliberate, and visible
- Losing infrastructure can stall or reverse progress

Technology reflects what a faction is **capable of sustaining**, not what it has selected.

---

## Technology Is Unlock-Based, Not Invented

All major technologies already exist in the universe.

Progression represents:
- Learning how to produce them
- Securing supply chains
- Training personnel
- Maintaining infrastructure

A faction does not “discover” steel — it learns how to **produce steel at scale**.

---

## Race-Specific Tech Trees

Each race has its **own technology tree**, reflecting:
- Biology
- Culture
- Industrial philosophy
- Military doctrine

This results in:
- Different ship designs
- Different station modules
- Different strengths and weaknesses
- No universal “best” tech

Example:
- Human capital ships ≠ Aurelian capital ships
- Heliox systems emphasize automation
- Khar tech favors mass production
- Nomari tech favors mobility and repair

---

## Tiered Technology Structure

Technology is grouped into **tiers**, but tiers are unlocked through capability, not XP.

---

### Tier I – Foundational Capability

Unlocked when a faction can:
- Refine common materials
- Manufacture basic components
- Maintain small stations

Examples:
- Basic hull plating
- Small ship frames
- Light station modules
- Civilian infrastructure

This tier defines survival.

---

### Tier II – Advanced Industrial Capability

Unlocked when a faction can:
- Produce advanced refined materials
- Sustain medium-scale manufacturing
- Secure stable logistics

Examples:
- Medium ships
- Advanced station modules
- Improved defenses
- Trade and commerce zones

This tier defines regional relevance.

---

### Tier III – Strategic Capability

Unlocked when a faction can:
- Secure rare material supply
- Maintain large stations
- Protect long supply chains

Examples:
- Capital ships
- Advanced weapons
- High-efficiency industry
- Political and economic dominance tools

This tier defines major powers.

---

## Technology Unlock Conditions

Technologies unlock when **prerequisites are met**, such as:

### Material Thresholds
Example:
- Stockpile 100 Iron Bars → unlock Steel Plate production
- Stockpile rare alloys → unlock advanced hulls

Materials are **consumed** or committed during unlock.

---

### Infrastructure Requirements
Example:
- Steel Plate production requires:
  - Refinery
  - Industrial power capacity
  - Skilled workforce

No infrastructure = no tech.

---

### Operational Experience
Some tech requires:
- Sustained usage
- Operational exposure

Example:
- Run a refinery for X days
- Operate trade routes at scale
- Maintain a fleet continuously

---

### Discovery & Acquisition
Advanced tech may require:
- Salvage
- Reverse engineering
- Data acquisition
- Rare schematics

Especially common for:
- Capital ship systems
- Exotic technologies
- Race-specific components

---

## No Global Tech Rush

- Unlocks are local to a faction
- Losing facilities can disable tech
- Sabotage can stall progression
- Captured infrastructure may grant partial access

Technology is **fragile**.

---

## Ship and Station Differentiation

Because tech trees are race-specific:
- Ships differ by doctrine, not tier
- Stations differ by philosophy
- No straight upgrades — only trade-offs

A Tier II Aurelian ship is not “better” than a Tier II Nomari ship — it is *different*.

---

## Player Experience

### Early Game
- Unlock basic production
- Learn material flows
- Choose specialization paths

### Mid Game
- Unlock advanced components
- Secure rare materials
- Differentiate from other factions

### Late Game
- Capital-scale tech
- Strategic assets
- Long-term dominance or collapse

---

## Strategic Implications

- Industry is power
- Logistics are technology
- Disruption is as powerful as advancement
- Stealing tech is about stealing **capability**, not blueprints

---

## Version Notes

This system is intentionally slower than traditional tech trees.
If players can:
- Rush all tech
- Unlock everything safely
- Progress without risk

Then the design has failed.

Technology must reflect **what a faction can actually sustain**.
