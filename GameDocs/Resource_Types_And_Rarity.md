# Resource Types and Rarity

This document defines the **resource economy pipeline** used across the galaxy.
All construction, trade, warfare, and expansion ultimately depend on these systems.

The design goal is:
- Logical, real-feeling production chains
- Clear risk vs reward
- No abstract “magic resources”
- Meaningful industrial gameplay

---

## Resource Categories Overview

All resources fall into **three primary categories**:

1. **Raw Resources** – Extracted from space and worlds  
2. **Refined Resources** – Processed industrial materials  
3. **Manufactured Components** – Complex, high-value goods  

Players and factions interact with all three layers.

---

## 1. Raw Resources

### Definition
Raw resources are directly **mined or harvested** from:
- Asteroid belts
- Planets
- Moons

They require minimal processing to extract but cannot be used directly for construction.

---

### Common Raw Resources
Widely available in:
- Core systems
- Inner faction systems
- Trade & minor faction space

Examples:
- Iron Ore
- Copper Ore
- Aluminum Ore
- Silicates
- Carbon Compounds
- Ice (water source)

---

### Rare Raw Resources
Found primarily in:
- Outer faction systems
- Outer rim space

Examples:
- Titanium Ore
- Rare Earth Elements
- Superconductive Crystals
- Exotic Gases
- Radioactive Isotopes

Rare raw resources are **strategic drivers of conflict**.

---

## 2. Refined Resources

### Definition
Refined resources are produced by **processing raw materials** in:
- Refineries
- Industrial stations
- Planetary factories

They are standardized, transportable, and form the backbone of manufacturing.

---

### Common Refined Resources
Produced in large quantities in core and trade space.

Examples:
- Iron Bars
- Steel Plates
- Aluminum Sheets
- Glass Panels
- Plastic Polymers
- Refined Fuel

---

### Advanced Refined Resources
Require:
- Rare raw inputs
- Advanced facilities
- Stable power supply

Examples:
- Titanium Alloy Plates
- Composite Materials
- Reinforced Glass
- Superconductive Wire
- High-Density Fuel Cells

---

## 3. Manufactured Components

### Definition
Manufactured components are **assembled goods** created from refined materials.
They represent the highest value density and industrial complexity.

These are what players and factions actually *build with*.

---

### Structural Components
Used in stations and hulls:
- Steel Hull Plates
- Reinforced Bulkheads
- Pressure Seals
- Structural Beams

---

### Mechanical Components
Used in ships and industry:
- Actuators
- Bearings
- Thruster Assemblies
- Pump Systems
- Hydraulic Lines

---

### Electronic Components
Used in control and navigation:
- Circuit Boards
- Navigation Systems
- Sensor Arrays
- Communication Relays
- Control Processors

---

### Industrial & Civil Components
Used in stations and cities:
- Power Couplings
- Environmental Systems
- Life Support Modules
- Industrial Robotics

---

## Example: Ship Construction Pipeline

To construct a **basic ship**, you might need:

- Steel Hull Plates
- Glass Panels
- Rubber Hoses
- Navigation System
- Basic Sensors
- Thruster Assemblies
- Power Couplings

Each of these components traces back to:
Raw → Refined → Manufactured

There are **no shortcuts**.

---

## Resource Distribution by Region

| Region | Common Raw | Rare Raw | Refined | Manufacturing |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Core Systems | High | Very Low | Very High | Very High |
| Inner Faction | High | Low | High | High |
| Outer Faction | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Trade / Minor | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Outer Rim | Low | High | Low | Very Low |

---

## Trade & Profit Logic

- Core space exports:
  - Refined and manufactured goods
- Outer rim exports:
  - Rare raw resources
- Trade zones:
  - Act as conversion hubs
- Smuggling thrives where tariffs are high

Profit comes from **moving resources up the chain**, not hoarding raw materials.

---

## Player Progression

### Early Game
- Trade refined goods
- Light manufacturing
- Small-scale refining

### Mid Game
- Control refineries
- Manufacture ship components
- Secure rare material supply

### Late Game
- Capital ship production
- Advanced component monopolies
- Vertical integration empires

---

## Strategic Implications
- Wars are fought over **supply chains**
- Blockades hurt more than battles
- Industrial collapse causes faction decline
- Rare materials define late-game power

---

## Version Notes
This system is intentionally grounded and expandable.
New materials should always map cleanly into:
Raw → Refined → Manufactured
